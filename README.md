# A-Level Project
This was the GitHub Project location for my A-Level Computer Science project to make an automatically updating celebrity status backend to facilitate the web based front end. It was intended to be a solution to an increasingly convoluted setup that my parents and their friends have for a rather macabre game they all play.

Whilst this was initially intended to be the hosted location for the A-level coursework, the teacher at the time notified me shortly after starting this repository that the code should be private and therefore any further updates moved to my local machine. Whilst the code would now, years later, the completed code would be alowed within this repository, it has been lost to time.
